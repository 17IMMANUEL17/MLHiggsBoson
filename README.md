# EPFL CS-433: Project 1 - ML Higgs

The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of physics which explains why other particles have mass. Its discovery at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN was announced in March 2013. In this project, we apply machine learning techniques to actual CERN particle accelerator data to recreate the process of "discovering" the Higgs particle.
